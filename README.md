# Physio_Counter

After my knee injury, I was in rehab for 4-5 months and had to perform various physiotherapy exericses.
After getting bored of saying 1...2....3 in my head, I decicded to use a make a small pythoin script so that I don't have to think about it anymore.
This script speaks the one, two... thing during exercise.
It lets the user input total number of exercises and repetition per exercise. Holding in a rep can also be changed.

It currently only works on linux.

To use it:
1) pip3 install pyttsx3

  It's the library used to convert text to speech
  
2) sudo apt-get install espeak

  Just in case you dont hear anything or an espeak error. Means this module isn't installed.
