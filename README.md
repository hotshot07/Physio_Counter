# Physio_Counter

Basically it speaks the one, two... thing during exercise.
It lets the user input total number of exercises and repetition per exercise. Holding in a rep can also be changed.

It currently only works on linux.

To use it:
1) pip3 install pyttsx3

  It's the library used to convert text to speech
  
2) sudo apt-get install espeak

  Just in case you dont hear anything or an espeak error. Means this module isn't installed.
